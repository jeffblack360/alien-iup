(important)
- lib order is broken (at least on Win32)
- NetBSD no default selected (set X11 for noGUI detected)

(medium priority)
- in "no gui detected" - we do not know what libs to add to config('libs'); we should rather die in this case
- remove old sharedir content during install
- more complex compile text (use some advanced iup C example)
- move lib detection into "perl Build.PL" phase

(low priority)
- MacOS - why autoenabling GTK?
- detection iup+cd+im: does not work with msvc 
- detection iup+cd+im: maybe we need to link with more libs to handle static linking
- tecmake: warning
  # tecmake.mak:1256: warning: overriding commands for target `../bin/Linux26g4'
  # tecmake.mak:1216: warning: ignoring old commands for target `../bin/Linux26g4'

(errors to be reported to tecgraf)
- IUP error: libiupmot.so: undefined reference to `XmScaleSetTicks' FreeBSD 7.2 / Cygwin 1.7
- using -fpic on FreeBSD 64bit
